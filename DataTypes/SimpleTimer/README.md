## Simple Timer
It's a my first try to do something like real timer clock

This class has a few methods:

*Start()* - starting checking the time

*Stop()* - stops checking the time and saves the end time

*Time()* - returns long long number in milliseconds. Returns current time if Start() was called, else returns End - Start time
